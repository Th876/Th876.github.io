<h1>The Best Movie Trivia Game Project</h1>
<p> The Best Movie Trivia Game is the first project I created at <a href="https://perscholas.org/courses/software-engineer/software-engineer-atlanta/">Per Scholas'</a> Software Engineer Training.</p> The game has three rounds and consists of 18 movie questions in total. Each question has two option answers. This is the <a href= "https://th876.github.io/triviagame/ ">website link</a> for my game project.

<h2>Game Features</h2>
<p>On the main page, the 'Start Game' button is disabled, which prompts the user to enter a name in order to play. As the user types a name, a warning message is displayed to ensure that an acceptable name format is given. This name is later displayed on the quiz page as, for example, 'Player: Anna'.</p>

<p>The trivia quiz begins at 'Round One' where the user can hear music playing softly in the background. The user's name and score is located to the left of the screen; and an 'Exit Game' button is located directly under the question and answer content.<p>  

<p>The game starts when the user selects an answer option. If the user selects an incorrect answer, the answer's background becomes red, no points are given, and a 'wrong answer' sound effect is played. However, if the user selects a correct answer, the answer's background becomes green, one point is given, and a 'right answer' sound effect is played.</p>

<p>Questions switch to the next as soon as the user selects an answer. Note: Users cannot return to the previous question and answer.</p>

<p>At the end of 'Round One' and 'Round Two', the user is greeted with a pop-up message which requires decision makingâ€”continue the game or end the game. If the user continues the game, The next round will begin and points from the previous round(s) are transferred. However, if the user ends the game, the results page is displayed. All points the user accumulated before ending the game are calculated and displayed as a percentage. The results page also displays if the user has won or lost the game.</p>

<p>When the pop-up message appears on screen, the background is blurred, the background music stops and users cannot interact with the background unless they click the 'Continue' button. When the 'Continue' button is clicked, the music resumes and the background is unblurred.</p>

<p>Each round has a pass mark of 83%. The user, therefore, wins the game if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> They've scored 5/6 (83%) or more for 'Round One'</li>
    <li> They've scored 10/12 (83%) or more for 'Round Two'</li>
    <li> They've scored 15/18 (83%) or more for 'Round Three' </li>
   </ul>
 
 <p>The 'Exit Game' button allows users to leave the game, and return to the start page without receiving a result. </p>
